## Auto Code Groups

If you have code blocks right after each other, they will be grouped together using [`code-group`](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/prose/code-group).

```md
    ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      modules: [],
    })
    ```

    ```ts [server/api/hello.get.ts]
    export default defineEventHandler(() => {
      return {
        hello: 'world'
      }
    })
    ```

    ```vue [app.vue]
    <template>
      <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
      </div>
    </template>
    ```
```

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [],
})
```

```ts [server/api/hello.get.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(() => {
  return {
    hello: 'world'
  }
})
```

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Steps

Generate steps by useing standard markdown numbered lists!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to generate this component, you need to have content inside at least one of the lists. The list can't be a child of another component & also any content within a Mardown list will need at least 2 tabs to be considered as a child of the list.
