# Docs Playground

Writing docs should be fun!

1. Install `unjs-docs` as a dev dependency
2. Create `docs.config.ts` and set the name, description, github and themeColor.

```ts
import { defineDocsConfig } from 'unjs-docs/config'

export default defineDocsConfig({
  name: 'Docs Theme',
  description: 'Default documentation for UnJS package.',
  github: 'unjs/docs',
  themeColor: '#f98007',
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> Color can be a HEX or RGB value.

3. Create `content/index.yml` for the homepage and `content/**.md` for the docs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set a custom subtitle and meta description in the front-matter of each markdown file with the key `description`. Otherwise, the first paragraph will be used and removed from the page to be used as a subtitle on the page and in the meta description.

4. Add a `favicon.svg` in the `public` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the icon from your package in the [design kit of the website](https://unjs.io/design-kit#package-logos).

5. Use `npx unjs-docs dev` to start in development mode and `npx unjs-docs build` to build for production!
